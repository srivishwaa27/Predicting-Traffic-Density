Smart Traffic Density Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a real-time traffic density prediction system using advanced machine learning techniques, tailored for smart city infrastructure. The goal is to enable data-driven urban traffic management by forecasting traffic congestion levels based on contextual inputs like city, time of day, vehicle type, weather, and more.

Overview
With growing urbanization and the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, traditional traffic systems fall short in dynamically adapting to real-time traffic patterns. This project addresses that challenge by leveraging machine learning to predict traffic density, helping reduce congestion, improve commute times, and enable smarter decision-making for city planners and commuters.

Key Features
Regression Models Used:

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score (All models scored > 0.99)

User Interface:

A Gradio-powered dashboard where users can input traffic conditions and receive predicted traffic density in real time.

Dataset
A synthetically generated urban traffic dataset was used, featuring attributes like:

City
